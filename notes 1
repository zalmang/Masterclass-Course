<style> in css: how to custom-style html
if it's a tag, the class format is
    tag {
        width: 60%;
        color: blue;
    }
if it goes by id, then it's
    #id {
        same;...
    }
if it goes by id, then it's

.class-name {
    background-color: ...;
}

learned about sudoclasses

.class-name:hover {
    style settings go here....
}

GOOD TO KNOW: also works with #id:hover
