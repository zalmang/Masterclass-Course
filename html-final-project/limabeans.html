    <ul>
        Ingredients
        <li>1 pound dry large lima beans</li>
        <li>1/2 large white onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 smoked turkey wings</li>
        <li>8 cups chicken stock (preferably unsalted or low-sodium)</li>
        <li>Additional salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cook the beans:<br>
        Place the beans, onion, garlic cloves, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, bay leaf, and turkey
        wings in a large Dutch oven or pot.</p>

    <p>Add the stock. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</p>

    <p>Once it starts to boil, decrease the heat to medium-low. Cover with a lid.</p>

    <p>Simmer for up to 2 hours or until the beans are tender to your liking. Make sure to stir the mixture a few times
        while cooking for a creamier sauce.</p>

    <p>Pick the meat from the turkey wings:<br>
        Using tongs, remove the turkey wings and let them cool until you can comfortably handle them. Remove the cooked
        meat from the bones using a fork and shred; discard the skin. Place the meat back in the pot.</p>

    <p>Remove the bay leaf; discard.</p>
