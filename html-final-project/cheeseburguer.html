        <h1>Cheeseburger Casserole</h1>
        <h3>PREP TIME 15 mins COOK TIME 30 mins TOTAL TIME 45 mins SERVINGS 6 to 8 servings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces (340g) dried elbow macaroni (about 6 cups dry pasta)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef (I like 80:20)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more as needed for salting the pasta water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>

        <p>Boil the pasta:<br>
            Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).<br>
            Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 9 to 11 minutes, until mostly cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite.<br>
            Using a colander, drain and set it aside.</p>

        <p>Cook the ground beef:<br>
            As the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef.<br>
            Season with oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin.<br>
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</p>

        <p>Add the butter and aromatics:<br>
            Add the butter, onions, garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with the ground beef.<br>
            Stir until all ingredients are combined.</p>

        <p>Combine the pasta and ground beef:<br>
            Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine.<br>
            Add the heavy whipping cream, chicken stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese.<br>
            Stir until combined.</p>

        <p>Add to a casserole dish:<br>
            Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top with the remaining cheese.</p>

        <p>Bake:<br>
            Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is browned and bubbly.</p>

        <p>Serve and store:<br>
            For a looser casserole, serve right away.<br>
            For a casserole that holds its shape a bit, let it sit for 10 minutes before serving.<br>
            The casserole will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days.<br>
            You can also freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to 3 months.<br>
            To reheat, microwave or place in the oven at 350°F until it is heated through (this will depend on the portion size you are reheating).</p>
